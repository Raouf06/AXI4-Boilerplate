AXI4 Lite Buses :
	- Write Address  Driven by the master
	- Write Data     Driven by the master
	- Write Response Driven by the slave
	- Read Address   Driven by the master
	- Read Data      Driven by the slave


### WRITE OPERATIONS BEGIN ###
-- Address Write Bus signals
Signal Name	| Source | Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACLK       	| Global | The global clock signal.
ARESETn		| Global | The global reset signal.
AWVALID		| Master | Write address from master is valid
AWREADY		| Slave  | Slave is ready to accept write address from master
AWADDRESS	| Master | The write address for the single write operation
AWPROT		| Master | Access protections. Optional


-- Protection Values for each Bus
Prot Bit | Description
Prot[0]  | 0 = Unprivileged access
         | 1 = Privileged access
Prot[1]  | 0 = Secure access
         | 1 = Unsecure access
Prot[2]  | 0 = Data access
         | 1 = Instruction access

-- Data Write Bus signals          
Signal Name	| Source | Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACLK       	| Global | The global clock signal.
ARESETn		| Global | The global reset signal.
WVALID		| Master | Write data from master is valid
WREADY		| Slave  | Slave is ready to accept write data from master
WDATA		| Master | The write data for the single write operation

-- Write Response Bus signals          
Signal Name	| Source | Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACLK       	| Global | The global clock signal.
ARESETn		| Global | The global reset signal.
BVALID		| Slave  | Write Response is valid from slave
BREADY		| Master | Master is ready to accept response
BRESP		| Slave  | Response information from slave

BRESP values : 
Response | Resp[1:0] | Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
OKAY	 | 00        | The write operation was a success
EXOKAY   | 01 		 | Exclusive access is okay
SLVERR   | 10 		 | The slave reports and error but address is in range
DECERR	 | 11 		 | The address was not in range of the slave

Write transaction flow :
(Master) Write address & Write address valid
(Slave ) Write address ready
(Master) Write data & Write data valid
(Slave ) Write data ready
(Slave ) Response & Response valid
(Master) Response ready
